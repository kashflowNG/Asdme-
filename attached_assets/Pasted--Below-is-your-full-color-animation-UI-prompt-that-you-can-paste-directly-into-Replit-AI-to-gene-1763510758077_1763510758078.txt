⭐ FULL NEO-NEON FUTURISTIC COLOR + ANIMATION PROMPT FOR REPLIT AI

**“Use a NEO-NEON FUTURISTIC design theme.
The UI must be dark, sleek, minimal, but enhanced with neon glow colors and soft animations.
Use these exact colors:

UI Style:
– Use neon glow effects: shadow 0 0 15px using the primary colors.
– Buttons should have 10–20px rounded corners with a soft neon outer glow.
– Use blur-glass cards with background-opacity: 0.1 and blur: 20px.
– Highlight elements with subtle neon borders (2px neon purple or cyan).
– Add smooth gradients like: linear-gradient(135deg, #8B5CF6, #06B6D4).

Animations to include:
– Soft floating animations (5–10px slow up-down motion) for icons or decorative shapes.
– Neon pulse effect on hover (slight brightness increase + glow).
– Smooth fade-in for all components (0.4s).
– Gradient shimmer animation on buttons.
– Glow ripple effect when clicking a button.
